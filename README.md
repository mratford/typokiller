# typokiller

## Running

```sh
uv run typokiller          # serves http://<this Mac>:8000 on the LAN
uv run pytest              # server tests
node --test tests/*.test.js   # typing rules tests
uv run pyright src tests   # type check
```

The database is `typokiller.db` in the current directory.

The server tests read real `.vil` and `vial.json` files from the `sweep-layouts` repo, which must sit next to this repo.
